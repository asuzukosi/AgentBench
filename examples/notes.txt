Extracting information about the project to be able to find the value in benchmarking
AI agents and how the benchmarks work.

This is used for the evaluation of LLMs as agents for a wide spectrum of tasks.
Were there any opensource or proprietary alternatives.

Environments for evaluating LLM agents
- Operating systems
- Database
- Knowledge Graph
- Digital Card Game (why?)
- Lateral Thinking Puzzle
- House Holding
- Web shopping (Web Shop)
- Web browsing (Mind2Web)

what kinds of applications would people want to use autonomous agents for and how do we evaluate it?

What are interactive environments, and can we build general purpose interactive environments?

While LLMs begin to manifest their proficiency in LLM-as-Agent, gaps between models and the distance towards practical
usability are significant - is there a definitive metric number point where would could target
to decide when LLM-as-Agent would become practically useful and economically viable

Or could this project itself be the frontend
